# Ingestor

A Rust library for ingesting on-chain data from the DoubleZero network's Solana programs.

## Overview

The `ingestor` crate is responsible for retrieving serviceability and telemetry data from the DoubleZero network's on-chain programs. It provides async interfaces to fetch network topology information (devices, links, operators) and performance telemetry data (latency samples, network metrics).
