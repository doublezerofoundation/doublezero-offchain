# Processor

A Rust library for processing raw telemetry data into statistical metrics for the DoubleZero network.

## Overview

The `processor` crate transforms raw telemetry data fetched from the blockchain into meaningful statistical metrics. It calculates network performance indicators such as round-trip time (RTT), jitter, packet loss, and generates both private (device-to-device) and public (location-to-location) link statistics (TBD).
